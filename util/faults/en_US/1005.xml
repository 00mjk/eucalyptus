        1) In eucalyptus.conf, locate the CLOUD_OPTS variable.
        2) Check to see if --XX:MaxPermSize=[value] is included in the CLOUD_OPTS value.
        3) If --XX:MaxPermSize value is not set, set it to a relatively large value.
           Default value is 64MB. (Value can be in bytes, or can be something like '64M' or '1G'.
        4) If --XX:MaxPermSize is already set, make the value larger.
        5) Restart the cloud application.
        6) If after setting --XX:MaxPermSize to the maximum allowable value, this condition
           continues, it may be necessary to add more physical memory to the
           machine.
