        1) In eucalyptus.conf, locate the CLOUD_OPTS variable.  
        2) Check to see if -Xmx=[value] is included in the CLOUD_OPTS value.
        3) If -Xmx value is not set, set it to a relatively large value.  
           Default values are either 1GB or 1/4 of the physical memory, 
           whichever is smaller.  Set it to at least that value.  (Value can
           be in bytes, or can be something like '64M' or '1G'.
        4) If -Xmx is already set, make the value larger.
        5) Restart the cloud application.
        6) If after setting -Xmx to the maximum allowable value, this condition
           continues, it may be necessary to add more physical memory to the
           machine.
