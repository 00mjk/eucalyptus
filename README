# Overview
Eucalyptus is open source software for building Amazon Web Services-compatible private and hybrid clouds.

# Requirements and Technical Notes
* Eucalyptus is broken into six components: Cloud Controller, Walrus, Cluster Controller, Storage Controller, Node Controller, and VMware Broker. These components are software services and are arranged in three layers: cloud, cluster, and nodes. You can install the components on the same physical server or on separate physical servers as business, security, and resource needs dictate. 
* The Node Controller requires libvirt and either Xen or KVM.
* The libraries that Eucalyptus depends on are described in detail 
in the INSTALL file.
* You will have to choose one of several network modes, which are
described in the installation guide. Your system's and network's
requirements will vary based on which mode you choose.
* You will need two IP address ranges. The first range is private, to be used only within the Eucalyptus system itself. The second range is public, to be routable to and from end-users and VM instances. Both sets must be unique to Eucalyptus, not in use by other components or applications within your network.
