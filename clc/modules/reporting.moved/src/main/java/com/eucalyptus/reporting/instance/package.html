<p>The reporting.instance package stores and retrieves instance
usage data. The stored usage data is used for subsequent report generation. 
Usage data includes things like disk bandwidth, network bandwidth, etc, for
each instance.

<p>The reporting mechanism gathers <i>samples</i> of usage data, meaning it
collects usage data from nodes every <i>n</i> seconds, and it assumes
continuous usage within those <i>n</i> seconds.  This results in a small
sampling error because the boundaries of reporting periods (ie months) will not
exactly correspond to the boundaries of the samples.

<p>Internally, the reporting mechanism stores its data as a series of usage
snapshots, every <i>n</i> seconds apart, for each instance.  Each snapshot
contains the cumulative resource usage of an instance up to the point when the
snapshot was taken. The reason it uses cumulative totals is to gain resilience
to lost packets despite unreliable transmission. If the reporting mechanism
misses an event, it will find out later (when the next event arrives) how many
resources had been used in the mean time. Lost messages result only in less
granular logs with larger intervals, but not any loss of essential information.
