<p>The reporting package tracks and stores usage information for instances,
S3, EBS, and other components. It stores that information in historical tables
for subsequent report generation.

<p>Communication with the reporting mechanism is by means of a <i>star
queue</i>. A star queue is a uni-directional asynchronous message queue
arraunged in a star topoology, meaning it has many senders on various
components, and one receiever at the center, in the reporting mechanism. See
the package documentation in com.eucalyptus.reporting.star_queue for further
details.

<p>The reporting mechanism stores <i>sampled</i> data about instance
usage. In other words, it receives information about disk bandwidth usage,
network bandwidth usage, etc, every <i>n</i> seconds from the CLC and assumes
constant usage during that interval. 

<p>Stored historical data can be retrieved by outside components using the
instance.InstanceUsageLog class. That class contains a method to query the
stored reporting data and convert it into desired time periods.

<p>See the package documentation in com.eucalyptus.reporting.instance for
further details.
