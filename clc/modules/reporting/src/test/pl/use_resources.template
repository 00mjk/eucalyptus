#
# use_resources.template is a template used to generate a perl file which is then inserted
#  into a bundled image. The generated perl file is then executed from within the instance
#  upon startup. The generated perl script writes random data to the local disk and to a
#  mounted EBS volume, from within a running instance, in order to simulate resource usage
#  for that instance. The reason we use a template is to overwrite the constants at the
#  top of this file, and so generate different usage for different test images. This allows
#  the test framework to control how much usage will be incurred by the various test
#  instances.
#
# This template is converted into a perl file using the fill_template.pl script.
