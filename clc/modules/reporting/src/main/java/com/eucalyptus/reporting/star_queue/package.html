<p>The reporting.star_queue package implements a <i>star queue</i>. A star queue
is a reliable asynchronous message queue, arranged in a <i>star topology</i>,
where the queue has many senders and one receiver. All messages flow from
the senders (at the points of the star) inward toward the one receiver at
the center of the star. A star queue is uni-directional.

<p>A star queue is used to gather information from many components to a
single reporting mechanism.

<p>Internally, the star queue mechanism consists of a number of JMS message
queues. Each component of the system (S3, EBS, etc) has a single
<i>StarSender</i>, each of which has its own JMS message queue; and all the
JMS message queues terminate in the single StarReceiver, which aggregates them
into one queue and then dispatches messages based on type.

<p>Usage: 
	yourComponent.addEventListener(StarSender.getInstance());
