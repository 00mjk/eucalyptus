<p>The event_store package provides a <i>persistent log</i> of reporting events. It contains 
reporting events which are also hibernate entities and which are persisted indefinitely. These
reporting events are different from the reporting events wihch are used to communicate with
the reporting subsystem, insofar as these events are only used to keep a <i>record</i> of which
events have occurred in the past and when.

<p>This packege contains <i>persistent events</i> for: instance creation, deletion, and usage; volume creation, deletion, and usage;
elastic ip creation, deletion, attachment, and detachment; and s3 bucket and object creation,
deletion, and usage.

<p>Although the event types are hibernate objects, this fact should be ignored by anyone
using this package. All hibernate operations are encapsulated within EntityStore classes,
which provide methods for inserting persistent events into the entity store. There is no
other way to instantiate the the entity objects (constructors are package access) and no
hiberante operations should take place outside of the EntityStore classes. For example,
if you wanted to record that an volume creation occured, you would call:

<p><code>ReportingVolumeEventStore.getInstance().insertVolumeCreateEvent(uuid, timestampMs, sizeGB, ...)</code>

<p>...and similarly with instance usage, bucket creation, etc etc. 

<p>All hibernate operations are encapsulated within EntityStore objects, because this package
may need to modify objects before they are persisted. This requires that the hibernate operations
be encapsulated.

<p>External users of this package only need to use the EntityStore objects, of which there are
six. All of them are singletons.

<p>Note that usage events for instances are different from all other usage events. Instance
usage events are persisted at periodic intervals (for example, 4 hours) whereas volume and
S3Object usage events are written as usage occurs, which may be rarely. Also, instances
have no delete events; instances are presumed to be destroyed when their usage events
cease.
