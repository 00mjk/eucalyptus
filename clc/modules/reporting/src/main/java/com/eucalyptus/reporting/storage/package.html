<p>The reporting.storage package contains classes for the storage and retrieval
of historical usage information for Walrus/S3. It could be used to generate
timely visual reports, of S3/Walrus usage over some past time period (like a
month), in order to monitor usage trends or to conduct billing.

<p>The reporting.storage package stores its accounting information as a series
of <i>snapshots</i>, each of which contains the total resource usage for
a given (owner,account,cluster,availability_zone) combination over some time
period.

<p>The reporting.storage package receives events from S3/Walrus indicating
 allocation and deallocation of Walrus/S3 objects. Then the reporting.storage
package uses those events to generate snapshots, every <i>n</i> seconds, of
total resource utilization for each (owner,account,cluster,zone) combination.

<p>Events are transmitted to the reporting.storage package over a reliable
message queue. Events are transmitted using the reporting.queue package.

<p>Reporting data stored by the reporting.storage package can be accessed
using the <pre>StorageUsageLog</pre> class. This class will allow you to scan
through the usage logs and gather usage information. This is the main class
for accessing reporting.storage information.

<p>In addition, there is a <pre>StorageDisplayDb</pre> class which is built
atop the <pre>StorageUsageLog</pre> class. The <pre>StorageDisplayDb</pre>
class adds logic for displayable Strings, unit conversions, and so on. It
emits displayable bean classes which can be used by jasper or other report
generation engines.

<p>The reporting.storage package is used by <pre>Reports</pre> class in the
<pre>www</pre> module, which generates visual reports based on user
selections.
