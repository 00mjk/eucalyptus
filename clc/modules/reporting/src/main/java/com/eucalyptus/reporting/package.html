<p>The reporting package tracks usage statistics, then generates visual reports
based upon those statistics. It tracks statistics for instance usage, EBS
usage, and S3 usage.

<p>The reporting mechanism gathers information by means of events which are
sent from various components of Eucalyptus. Events are sent from the CLC and
Walrus, to the reporting mechanism. Events contain information regarding
things like instance usage, EBS usage, and S3 usage. Instance events are
sent periodically (once every 20 seconds) whereas EBS and S3 events are
sent every time something notable happens within storage (for example,
when an s3 object is allocated).

<p>The events are aggregated into reporting statistics, which are stored as
a series of <i>snapshots</i> in the database. Each snapshot contains the
total usage for a given (user,account,cluster,avail_zone) tuple at a given
moment in time. A series of snapshots across some period (say 2010.01.01 to
2011.01.01) could be used to extrapolate statistics of usage which could
then be used to generate a visual report.

<p>The reporting mechanism is divided into 3 main sub-packages: instance,
storage, and s3. The sub-packages are responsible for handling usage
statistics for instances, EBS, and S3 respectively. Each sub-package has its
own event listener for usage events, its own database tables, its own separate
statistics which are tracked, its own logic for storing, retrieving, and
aggregating statistics, and so on.

<p>The sub-packages all have the following classes:
<ul>
 <li><i>UsageSnapshot</i> - a snapshot of resource usage at a moment of time,
     keyed by a (user,account,cluster,avail_zone,timestamp) tuple, and mapped
     to the DB using hibernate. A UsageSnapshot consists of a <i>SnapshotKey</i>
     object and a <i>UsageData</i> object.</li>
 <ul>
  <li><i>SnapshotKey</i> - A key for usage snapshots. Consists of (user,account,
     cluster,avail_zone,timestamp).</li>
  <li><i>UsageData</i> - Statistics of usage (like disk bandwidth used or S3
     objects used) at a single moment in time.</li>
 </ul>
 <li><i>UsageSummary</i> - Contains aggregated resource usage over an
     extended period of time. Aggregates several UsageSnapshots.</li>
 <li><i>UsageLog</i> - A singleton object which allows retrieval of statistics
     for some time period. This is the main class for accessing reporting
     statistics for each sub-package. Contains logic for database queries,
     extrapolation, fractional periods, and so on. Contains a single primary
     method called <i>scanLog</i> for gathering usage information.</li>
 <li><i>ReportLine</i> - A bean which represents a single line in a visual
     report. It's like a UsageSummary, but with units adjusted for
     human-readable units (hours instead of milliseconds) and human-readable
     strings for criteria values</li>
 <li><i>ReportLineGenerator</i> - A wrapper around UsageLog which converts
     units, generates displayable Strings, and returns displayable
     ReportLines</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes in the various sub-packages do not implement common interfaces
because they are similar only in a very abstract sense, and do not store the
same statistics, or have the same method signatures, or use exactly the same
keys, and so on. They follow a common general design and so use similarly-named
classes (but with Instance-, Storage-, or S3- naming prefixes). But the
sub-packages have different method signatures and different statistics tracked,
which generally prevents implementing common interfaces. For example, the S3
package has keys that lack properties for cluster or availability zone, since
S3 is global and has no notion of clusters or zones. As another example, the
sub-packages all store different aggregated statistics with different Java
properties. Also, the UsageData objects in the various sub-packages store
completely different attributes and are mapped by Hibernate to separate tables.
And there are other fundamental differences which affect method signatures and
prevent common interfaces. The only classes which implement common interfaces
are <i>ReportLine</i> and <i>ReportLineGenerator</i>.

<p>The reporting mechanism also has a <i>queue</i> package for transmitting
events over the network if necessary, and a <i>units</i> package for unit
conversions.

<p>The reporting mechanism has a <i>ReportGenerator</i> class which acts as a
facade for all the underlying logic and is the only class accessed by outside
facilities. It has a single method: <i>generateReport</i>.
