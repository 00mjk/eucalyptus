keypair_dialog_add_help = Eucalyptus uses cryptographic keypairs to verify access to instances. Before you can run an instance, you must create a keypair using the euca-add-keypair command. Creating a keypair generates two keys: a public key (saved within Eucalyptus) and a corresponding private key (output to the user as a character string). To enable this private key you must save it to a file and set appropriate access permissions (using the chmod command), as shown in the example below.   When you create a VM instance, the public key is then injected into the VM. Later, when attempting to login to the VM instance using SSH, the public key is checked against your private key to verify access. Note that the private key becomes obsolete when the public key is deleted.

You can filter the results to return information only about key pairs that match criteria you specify. For example, you could filter the results to return only the key pairs whose names include the string Dave. You can specify multiple values for a filter. A key pair must match at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the results. You can specify multiple filters (for example, the key pair name includes the string Dave, and the fingerprint equals a certain value). The result includes information for a particular key pair only if it matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned; the response is simply empty. You can use wildcards with the filter values: * matches zero or more characters, and ? matches exactly one character. You can escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For example, a value of \*amazon\?\\ searches for the literal string *amazon?\."
